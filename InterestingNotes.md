## Interesting Notes
- tcpm.o would not build with the typec.h from the private/google-modules/soc/gs/include/trace/hooks directory
- Kernel build recommended disabling CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF (install dwarves that includes pahole)

## Things to remember you changed
- 16k include statements are disabled in the device trees for zuma
